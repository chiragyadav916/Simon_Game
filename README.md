# Simon_Game
 Simon Says is a classic memory game where players must remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. Starting with a simple pattern, players progress through increasingly complex sequences by accurately replicating each one. Mistakes end the game, challenging players to improve their memory and concentration skills in this timeless favorite.
