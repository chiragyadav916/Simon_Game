# Simon Game

Welcome to the Simon Game - a classic memory game where you test your memory skills by repeating a sequence of colours and sounds!
 
Simon Says is a classic memory game that challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colours and sounds. In this electronic adaptation, players are presented with a series of colourful buttons that light up and emit tones in a specific sequence. The game starts with a simple pattern, and as the player successfully reproduces each sequence, the pattern becomes progressively longer and more complex.

To play, the game generates a sequence of colours and sounds, which the player must then repeat by pressing the corresponding buttons in the correct order. With each successful repetition, the game adds another colour to the sequence, increasing the difficulty. However, if the player makes a mistake and presses the wrong button or forgets the sequence, the game ends, and the player must start over.

Simon Says is not only entertaining but also an excellent exercise for memory and concentration. Players must pay close attention to the sequence and recall it accurately to advance in the game. With its simple yet challenging gameplay, Simon Says is a timeless favourite for testing and improving memory skills.
